# üöÄ GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

Follow these steps to deploy your Statistics Charts Application to GitHub Pages.

## Prerequisites

1. GitHub account
2. Git installed on your computer
3. The statistics_proj folder with all files

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the **"+"** button in the top right
3. Select **"New repository"**
4. Name it: `statistics_proj` (or any name you prefer)
5. Make sure it's **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
6. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click **"Create repository"**

### 2. Initialize Local Git Repository

Open Command Prompt/Terminal in your `statistics_proj` folder:

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit files
git commit -m "Initial commit: Statistics Charts Application"

# Add remote repository (replace xrayian with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/xrayian/statistics_proj.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

If you get an error about the branch name, try:
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section (left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select **"Deploy from a branch"**
5. Select branch: **main**
6. Select folder: **/ (root)**
7. Click **Save**

### 4. Access Your Live Application

1. GitHub will show you the URL: `https://xrayian.github.io/statistics_proj`
2. It may take 5-10 minutes for the first deployment
3. The URL will be displayed in the Pages settings

## üîÑ Updating Your Application

To update your deployed application:

```bash
# Make your changes to the files
# Then commit and push:

git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
git push
```

GitHub Pages will automatically update within a few minutes.

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Application loads at your GitHub Pages URL
- [ ] All chart types work correctly
- [ ] Sample data buttons function
- [ ] Charts display properly
- [ ] Statistics calculations work
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**1. 404 Error on GitHub Pages URL**
- Wait 5-10 minutes after enabling Pages
- Check that Pages is enabled in repository settings
- Ensure repository is public

**2. Application doesn't load**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify all files are in the root directory
- Make sure `index.html` exists in root

**3. Charts don't display**
- Check internet connection (Chart.js loads from CDN)
- Verify JavaScript console for errors
- Test with sample data first

**4. Push fails**
- Check your GitHub credentials
- Verify repository URL is correct
- Try using personal access token instead of password

### Need Help?

1. Check GitHub's [Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)
2. Verify your repository is public
3. Check that all files are properly committed
4. Look for error messages in browser console

## üì± Mobile Testing

Test your deployed application on:
- Desktop browsers
- Mobile browsers
- Tablet devices

The application is responsive and should work on all screen sizes.

## üîí Security Note

Since this is a client-side application:
- No server-side code runs
- No user data is stored
- All processing happens in the browser
- Safe for public deployment

## üéâ Success!

Once deployed, your Statistics Charts Application will be available worldwide at:
**`https://xrayian.github.io/statistics_proj`**

Share this URL with anyone who needs to create statistical charts!
